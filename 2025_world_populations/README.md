# Introduction
This is the final project of the FAES class BIOF309 I took in 2025.

## Data sources
**countries_of_the_world.csv** : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fernandol/countries-of-the-world  
**population.csv** :  https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth

## Final analysis
**File name**: world_population_analysis.ipynb <br>
Hypothesis 1: I was told that world population has been constantly increasing, I want to verify using the dataset. 
Hypothesis 2: China and India have the largest populations.
Hypothesis 3: Richer countries have lower population growth rate.
